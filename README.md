## Local Install
Unless there's actual demand for this, I don't plan to publish this trivial extension to the Store, so:
1. Download the code here as a zip or git clone
2. [Follow the instructions here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/extensions/guides/adding-and-removing-extensions) to sideload it
